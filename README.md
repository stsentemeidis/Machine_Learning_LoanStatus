# Machile Learning Loan Status in SPARK

This project is dedicated to developing a full **Machine Learning Pipeline** in order to predict whether a **customer is going to pay a loan or not.**

This case study of the Washington D.C Bike Sharing System aims to predict the total number of users on an hourly basis. The dataset is [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/loan-default-prediction). It contains usage information of years 2011 and 2012.
